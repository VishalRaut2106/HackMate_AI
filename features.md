- **Jira**: "How do we track and manage existing work?"
- **HackMate AI**: "How do we turn ideas into actionable work plans using AI?"

**Our business model succeeds because:**
1. We serve an underserved market (students, hackathons, innovation teams)
2. We use AI to create 10x value (time savings) vs. incremental improvements
3. We have viral growth mechanics built into team collaboration
4. We can scale globally without the enterprise sales complexity
5. We're building for the future of work (AI-assisted, remote, rapid iteration)

**The result**: A sustainable, scalable business that grows with the AI revolution while Jira remains stuck in the pre-AI era of manual project management.
